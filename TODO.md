Project Description

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

<!--Pull individual Views IDLY into the "In Progress" and break down the stuff in parens into individual list items when working on them-->

### Views I don't like yet

- Welcome Page (Explains nothing)
- New User Page (Should explain the formatting and have better nav)
- Edit Page (Needs to know if the user is logged in or not)
- Raw Page (Don't know how it actually feels to access)
- List of Articles (This might actually be nice, but it can probably use more things)
- Article Settings (Needs to handle published mode, title, summary, and imply rbac stuff.)
- User Settings (Needs to handle changing display name and vanity settings and allow downloading notes)

### Todo

- ⭐ Swap to Server JS
- Add Passport & Discord Oauth
- See if theres a view thats just template literals
- Find a testing suite (Jest?)
- Create Unit Tests for the Views
- Create Unit Tests for the Functions
- Prep Procfile and ENV for Piku needs

### Done ✓
