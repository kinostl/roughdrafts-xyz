# Project

v2 Focuses on adding more utilities - On-site login, searching, tagging, and "global tag".

### Todo

- Account Embed
- Home Page Embed

### In Progress

- Slush Tabs

### To Detail

- Article tagging (This can be inside the text somehow probably)
- Global Tags (Useful for group stuff. This can probably be pretty similar to Article tagging but use a different tag fronter. Maybe the `@` symbol? `!` was suggested. Also `$` tags.)
- Article searching

- Role Based Access like letting others edit or specific viewing
- Add User accounts (email + username/password + magic link) https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-basic-auth

- File History
- Edit suggestions workflow
- Ability to import notes feature

### Won't Do

- Alternative interfaces like git
- Improve Unit Tests for the Views
- LDAP and similar?
- More Login Options? ~~https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-oauth-server~~

### Eventually

- Theming? (How? This would require CSS. V3)

### Done âœ“

- Article Embedsd
