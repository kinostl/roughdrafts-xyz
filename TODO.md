<!-- Testing tutorial https://www.albertgao.xyz/2017/05/24/how-to-test-expressjs-with-jest-and-supertest/ -->
<!-- Prisma has a jest mock https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing -->

### Todo

- ⭐ Swap to Server JS
- Add Passport & Discord Oauth
- See if theres a view thats just template literals
- Find a testing suite (Jest?)
- Create Unit Tests for the Views
- Create Unit Tests for the Functions
- Prep Procfile and ENV for Piku needs
- Organize functions and files to make testing easier?
- Add plugins to markdown-it

### Done ✓

### Views I don't like yet

- Welcome Page (Explains nothing)
- New User Page (Should explain the formatting and have better nav)
- Edit Page (Needs to know if the user is logged in or not)
- Raw Page (Don't know how it actually feels to access)
- List of Articles (Needs link to User Settings, search functions, and filtering. Like tags & published status.)
- Article Settings (Needs to handle published mode, title, summary, and imply rbac stuff. Also needs ability to delete article. Might need ability to transfer article ownership?)
- User Settings (Needs to handle changing display name and vanity settings and allow downloading notes)
