Project Description

<!--Pull individual Views IDLY into the "In Progress" and break down the stuff in parens into individual list items when working on them-->
<!-- Testing tutorial https://www.albertgao.xyz/2017/05/24/how-to-test-expressjs-with-jest-and-supertest/ -->
<!-- Prisma has a jest mock https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing -->

### Todo

- Prepare functions for unit testing  
- [Make a template engine for js files with template literals](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/developing-template-engines.html) (See notes.md, this is drafted)  
- Add Passport & Discord Oauth  
- See if theres a view thats just template literals  
- Find a testing suite (Jest?)  
- Create Unit Tests for the Views  
- Create Unit Tests for the Functions  
- Prep Procfile and ENV for Piku needs  
- Add plugins to markdown-it  
- Setup Prisma to actually use mysql instead  

### Done ✓

- ⭐ Swap to Server JS  
- Organize functions and files  

### Views I don't like yet

- Welcome Page (Explains nothing)  
- New User Page (Should explain the formatting and have better nav)  
- Edit Page (Needs to know if the user is logged in or not)  
- Raw Page (Don't know how it actually feels to access)  
- List of Articles (Needs link to User Settings, search functions, and filtering. Like tags & published status.)  
- Article Settings (Needs to handle published mode, title, summary, and imply rbac stuff. Also needs ability to delete article. Might need ability to transfer article ownership?)  
- User Settings (Needs to handle changing display name and vanity settings and allow downloading notes)
